# Provision High Availability Jenkins on AWS

## Overview

To be completed

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS account
- AWS CLI installed
- Terraform installed
- Ansible installed
- AWS Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code (Optional)

## (Optional) Setup Github Codespace

> **Note:** This step is optional and can be skipped if you are not using Github Codespace.

All configuration files are available in the `.devcontainer` directory. Feel free to change the configuration to suit your needs. All you need to do is to create a new Github Codespace and you are good to go.

To protect your AWS credentials, you need to add them as Github secrets. Here is how to do it:

- Open your Github repository settings
- Go to the `Secrets and variables` section
- In "Codespaces" section, click on "New repository secret" button and add the following secrets:
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- (Optional) If you're already created a Github Codespace, you need to reload the Codespace to apply the changes.
